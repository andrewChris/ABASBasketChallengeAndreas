You should expect this challenge to take 2-4 hours, so if you don't have the time just
do want you can do and make comments for the next steps you would take

Create a shopping basket, basket item and basket item types.

Design and create a UI that displays:
- the contents of the shopping basket;
- the total cost of the basket; and 
- the most expensive item.

Create forms that allows the user to add new basket items and basket item types.

This will be tested by adding a banana ($3), detergent ($10) and a packet of pasta ($1 each)
